Welcome to Isadora Vieira's Programming Journey! 👩‍💻✨
Hello there! I'm Isadora Vieira, a passionate individual diving into the fascinating world of programming. This repository serves as a compilation of all the projects I've crafted in Portugol during my Front-End Development course. As a proud student of Computer Science at the age of 25, I'm eager to share my progress and learning experiences.

🚀 About Me
I am Isadora Vieira, and my journey in the vast field of Computer Science is a testament to the power of continuous learning. As a woman in tech, I embrace the challenges and opportunities that come my way. 

🌈 Embracing Progressivism and Feminism
In this space, I aim to contribute not only as a developer but as an advocate for progressivism and feminism. I believe in equal opportunities, breaking stereotypes, and fostering a diverse and inclusive tech community.

I invite you to explore my projects, witness my journey, and perhaps find inspiration for your own. Feel free to connect with me on GitHub, share insights, or collaborate on exciting projects. Let's champion diversity, empowerment, and innovation in the world of technology.
